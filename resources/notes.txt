First test for adding two numbers. 

intent {
  goal: playground.example.grabTotal
  value: playground.example.firstNumberConcept(1)
  value: playground.example.secondNumberConcept(2)
}


When I did the training "1 plus 2", any other variation worked well. Examples: 1 minus 8, 4 times 10, etc.
I need to add the training "add one and ten". Otherwise the program gets confused because it's getting too many arguements.
